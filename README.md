# Project_Sushrut
The name of the project is inspired by Sushruta who is the father of surgery. If the history of science is traced back to its origin, it probably starts from an unmarked era of ancient time.
Project Sushrut is an innovative project that leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to revolutionize medical image analysis. With a focus on detecting abnormalities in medical images, this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and improving patient care.
